# onthisday

"On This Day" displays history weather data about your current location. 
It shows the weather data for the same day in the past years. 

This is a demo project using SQLite with [SQL.js-HTTPVFS](https://github.com/phiresky/sql.js-httpvfs) as a free database deployed on Github Pages.

The weather data is based on [this weather dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/global-daily-climate-data?resource=download)

**You can learn more about how it works and how I made it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYP0k_shdWc)**.
